                        Over the summer, all second year engineering-physics students at UBC took ENPH 253 - a five credit, hands on robotics course.

                        This proved to be the main event of the summer. The course ran from May to August and gave a real experience of working in a team on a tight schedule.

                        The team made a website dedicated to displaying some of the aspects involved in the design.
