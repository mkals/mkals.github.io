                        I am on a team of five that is working to build a 3D-scanner. Our hardware design follows some of the ideas used in the Ray in that the frame is made from interlocking, laser-cut hardboard for cheap and easy manufacture. Metal rods are used for greater modularity. A Raspberry Pi model 3 functions as the central control unit, interfacing the stepper, cameras, laser and memory-export.

                        When plugging in a memory-stick, the scan starts automatically. The scanner uses two cameras to take pictures each of the object (one with the line laser on and one with it off) for each position. A stepper-motor rotates the turn-table with a potential resolution of 0.2 degrees per step. The images are written directly to the memory-stick and taken to the computer for post-processing.

                        We have run successful image captures, but we require greater consistency of lighting etc. from the cameras to obtain a good result when converting the images to a point cloud. Work is therefore currently being put into converting the Python-code to lower levels where we have greater control of timing and camera settings.
