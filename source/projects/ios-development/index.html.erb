                        After starting university I have worked on multiple projects including a variometer and tracklog application for the iPhone, random-number generator for the Apple Watch and latest an app for version-control and annotation of poetry. None of these have received sufficient attention to go beyond being on my own devices.

                        I got introduced to programming in 2012 through the internet. Being very fascinated by the apple eco-system, iOS became the first platform that I leaned to write for, using Objective C and X-Code 4.3. In December of that year, my first app got onto the app store. It was a simple bounce-the-ball game I called Little P, made for the iPad.

                        Learning from the internet required persistence. The smallest issues would at times keep me stomped for weeks. The capabilities never stopped fascinating me, and getting the app launched became a milestone that made me all the more eager to start university and get a firmer hold of coding, algorithms and proper practices.

                        My second app got onto the store a year later. This was a password-protected utility-application for storing sensitive information, including login credentials, credit card information and personal notes.

                    <p>
                        I took both these apps off the app store earlier this year, as I have not had the time to maintain them over the last years.
