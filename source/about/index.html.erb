                        I am 21 years old and from Lier, Norway. In 2014 I started my engineering studies at UBC and in 2015 I was admitted to the Engineering Physics program. I expect to graduate with a Bachelor of Applied Science in May 2019, having completed four Co-op terms.

                        Cross country and downhill skiing have both been an important part of my winters. The family having a small apartment in one of Norway's largest skiing-resorts, Trysil, weekends and holidays have been spent outdoors and in the snow in winter-time.

                        Gard and I got our speed-riding licences in Voss, 2014. The speed, precision and energy these wings offer is captivating in the extreme.
