                        My family means a lot to me. Having grown up traveling to the mountains, a love of nature and outdoor recreation have been instilled in my siblings and me from a tender age. The picture is from Whistler, taken the summer I stared university in Vancouver.

                        Gard and I got our speed-riding licences in Voss, 2014. The speed, precision and energy these wings offer is captivating in the extreme.

                        I got my tandem paragliding licence three years ago, and have had great fun taking family and friends along in the air. On the picture we see my sister and me coming in for landing in Trysil during the winter holiday in 2014.
