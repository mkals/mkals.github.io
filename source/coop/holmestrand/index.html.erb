<h1>Holmestrand Stasjon</h1>
<p>
Holmestrand Stasjon is a train station that is being built inside a mountain hall in Sandefjord, Norway.
</p>
<p>
Four parallel tracks pass the 250 m platforms. Trains will be able to pass in the centre tracks at speeds of 260km/h, requiring careful handling of pressure and acoustics. A steel sealing below the tunnel roof was installed in order to accomplish this in addition to handle the water that trickles down from the rock.
