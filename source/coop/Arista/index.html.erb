                    <p>
                        My current work-term as a hardware engineer at Arista Networks is lending me insight into a fast paced environment in which I am given significant responsibility and where I am required to keep to strict deadlines. By the time I finish the term I will have led the development of six PBC designs including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>component selection</li>
                        <li>schematic capture</li>
                        <li>writing documentation</li>
                        <li>routing</li>
                        <li>overseeing layout</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These boards include both high-speed SERDES communication and power delivery.

                    <p>
                        In the lab I am working with system bringup, DPM configuration, eye-calibration, SI verification, rework and debugging.
